# Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation and research work for detecting Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) from ECG signals using deep learning techniques. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.  

---

##  Project Overview
Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is one of the most common irregular heart rhythms.  
Early detection is critical to reduce the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications.  

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can automatically analyze ECG signals and classify them as AFib or non-AFib, making detection more accurate and efficient.

##  Dataset
This project uses ECG data from publicly available sources:  
- [MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (PhysioNet)](https://physionet.org/content/afdb/1.0.0/)  
- [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)  

 Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to size limits. Please download it from the above links before running the notebook.
